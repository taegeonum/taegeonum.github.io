## About me

I am a PhD candidate at Seoul National University (SNU) [Software Platform Lab (SPL)](https://spl.snu.ac.kr/), advised by Prof. [Byung-Gon Chun](https://bgchun.github.io/). 
My interest lies in building, designing, and optimizing large-scale distributed (real-time) data processing and pipeline systems in the cloud to efficiently process data with high throughput and low latency.
